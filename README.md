Environment

      Our AstN-Net is only implemented in PyTorch 1.4.0 (or higher). 



Content (Folders):

      1. Data: includes dataset;

      2. Src: includes 'train.py', 'testing.py', 'model.py', 'layer.py', 'utils.p
	'train.py' is executable.
	'testing.py' is executable.
	'model.py' and 'layer.py' build up our AstN-Net architecture.
	'utils.py' can display the running results on the screen.

      3. Results: saves the results of the train and test;

      4. Checkpoint: includes includes optimal ANet params and NNet params.



Run

      We directly run test.py or train.py in the Src file, as follows:

            python test.py or python train.py
